                                                (unless a legal or regulatory obligation requires us to terminate the services in a

                                            or contractual effect. Our Business Terms are written in English (U.S.). Any translated
                                            version is provided solely for your convenience. To the extent any translated version
                                            of our Terms conflicts with the English version, the English version controls. Terms
                                            such as “including” are to be construed without limitation. Nothing in these Business
                                            Terms will prevent us from complying with the law. These Business Terms do not
                                            establish any agency, partnership, or joint venture between Company and Busyness
                                            App. Except as set out in the Data Transfer Addendum (where applicable pursuant to
                                            the Data Processing Terms), these Business Terms do not give any third-party
                                            beneficiary rights. If we fail to enforce any of these Business Terms, it will not be
                                            considered a waiver. Unless a mutually executed agreement between Company and
                                            us states otherwise, these Business Terms make up the entire agreement between
                                            Company and us regarding our Business Services and supersede any prior written or
                                            oral agreements.
